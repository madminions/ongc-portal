<li>New Sources of Energy</li>
<li>Production from small and marginal fields</li>
<li>ONGC has taken structured initiatives to tap unconventional energy sources through unconventional gases like Coal Bed Methane (CBM), Underground Coal Gasification (UCG), Shale Gas and Gas Hydrates, or unconventional energy sources like wind, solar etc. </li>
<li>"ONGC Energy Centre Trust", a dedicated centre created by ONGC for holistic research in non-conventional energy sources, has taken up three projects viz., Thermo-chemical reactor for Hydrogen, Geo-bio Reactors and Fuel Cells. ONGC has already commissioned a 50 MW Wind Farm in Gujarat and plan is afoot to set up another 100 MW Wind Farm in Rajasthan. ONGC has also set up 3 Solar Thermal Engines at Solar Energy Centre, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) campus at Gurgaon.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value-chain integration</h3>
<ul>
<li>ONGC's purchase of majority stake in equity in the ailing Mangalore Refinery &amp; Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL), a stand-alone refinery of 9.69 MMT capacity in March 2003 is a standout testimony of ONGC's integrated business model. Besides adding that desired comfort to this Company in mitigating higher risk of E&amp;P operation, this deal also set an example in the Indian business history where a PSU has taken over a joint stock company and turned it around in a record time of one year.</li>
<li>Moving ahead, ONGC has taken structured initiatives towards value-multiplier integration projects like – Refinery, LNG, Petrochemicals, Power, SEZ, etc., to have presence in the entire hydrocarbon value-chain.</li>
